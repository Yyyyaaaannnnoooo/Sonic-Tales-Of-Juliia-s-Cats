# The Sonic Tales of Juuliia's Cats

"The Sonic Tales of Juuliia's Cats" is a folkloric myth set within a fictional world. It is the story of three gigantic cats whose eternal sleep has been interrupted by the loud hum of data-centers. In reaction to the sudden end of their rest the cats materialize in the real world and surround the data center. To contrast the hum of the servers they start to purr. The latter violently makes all of the data-center material resonate and ultimately it shatters the machinery into pieces.
